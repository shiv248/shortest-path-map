# route.py
#
# This script defines several utility classes that can be used in the
# implementation of route-finding search algorithms. In particular, the
# file defines the following classes:
#   * RoadMap - encodes a graph containing locations and road segments
#   * RouteProblem - a formal search problem
#   * Node - a search tree node
#   * Frontier - the fringe of a search tree, implemented as either a
#                queue or a stack
# Each class includes relevant methods for the given objects.
#
# The script also uses a global node expansion counter and a search
# depth limit, with the latter parameter used to stop infinite loops.
#
# The contents of this file are referenced from the book
# "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and
# Peter Norvig.
